## Build Commands

```bash
open supacode.xcodeproj              # Open in Xcode (primary development)
make build-ghostty-xcframework       # Rebuild GhosttyKit from Zig source
make build-app                       # Build macOS app (Debug) via xcodebuild
make run-app                         # Build and launch Debug app
```

## Architecture

Supacode is a macOS orchestrator for running multiple coding agents in parallel, using GhosttyKit as the underlying terminal.

## Code Guidelines

See `./docs/swift-rules.md` for Swift/SwiftUI conventions. Key points:

## Rules

- After a task make sure the app builds properly.
- Use Peekabo skill to verify UI behavior if necessary.
